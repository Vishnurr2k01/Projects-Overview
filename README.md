PROBLEM: <br/><br/>
Decision making power in institutions is centralized and influenced by personal bias, leading to dissatisfaction among those affected. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) can solve this issue, but only if organizations have tokens to scale up.
<br/><br/>
SOLUTION: <br/><br/>UniDAO aims to introduce transparency, decentralization, and distribution in all organizations by involving everyone in the decision-making process through polls. UniDAO uses a unique poll process where <strong> each individual's vote is weighed according to their positional power in the organization, rather than shareholder tokens </strong>. UniDAO achieves decentralization through the use of <strong> separate DAOs for user/admin enrollment/dis-enrollment and adding new proposals </strong>, hence the name UniDAO (Unification of DAOs). Only admins can add proposals, but both admins and users can vote on proposals, with each person having only one vote. The proposal to add another admin or user is a separate DAO, with only admins allowed to vote. After a proposal expires, the result can be viewed (passed/rejected), but user votes remain anonymous.

Our product helps investors to save time and energy researching cryptocurrencies to invest in. Our product helps beginner investors to take calculated risks and diversify their portfolios of crypto experts. Our application helps crypto experts earn money as commission from the users of their created crypto portfolio.
Users can also view their friend's investment allocations and invest in them.
Users can use any exchange of their wishes in order to invest in a crypto collection.

For example:
An investor who uses CoinDcx will be able to invest in tokens specified in the crypto basket. (eg: 50% BTC, 50% eth basket)
We are also planning to expand this by adding Android, and ios support.

We also have a games section in which users can play a fantasy cricket league in which users can bet on cricket players.
Current problem with web2 fantasy sports games are even they can create a team at the end of the game and bag the cash prize.
