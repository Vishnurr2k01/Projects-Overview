PROBLEM STATEMENT

-> Presently the decision making power in an institution is centralised and lies at the hands of a few individuals . More than often these decisions are affected by a personal bias and are not rational and transparent in nature.

->This mostly leads to dissatisfaction among people who are at the receiving end of those decisions.
Decentralised Autonomous Organisations, being an important element of Web3, have the privilege of solving this by decentralizing decision making by involving everyone by incorporating native or crypto tokens.
This is unachievable for organizations without tokens ,having no means to scale up into higher levels of technology.

SOLUTION

->Our aim is to introduce transparency, decentralization and distribution in every organizations by giving everyone the chance to involve in the decision making process through polls.
Working :
->What distinguishes UniDAO from other native DAOs is its unique poll process wherein each individual's vote is weighed according to their positional power in the organisation and not according to shareholder tokens.UniDAO achieves decentralisation by the use of separate DAO's for user/Admin enrollment/disenrollment and addding new proposals, thus the name UniDAO(Unification of DAO's).
Proposals can only be added by Admins,while Admins as well as users can vote in the proposal(only one vote).
The proposal to add another admin is a separate DAO and only admins can vote in it.
After a proposal has expired the result of the proposal can be viewed(passed/rejected) but the votes corresponding to each user can not be identified, thus maintaining anonymity.
