I have built several projects on EVM based chains which includes DAOs, a fantasy game etc

PROBLEM: <br/>
Decision making power in institutions is centralized and influenced by personal bias, leading to dissatisfaction among those affected. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) can solve this issue, but only if organizations have tokens to scale up.
<br/>
SOLUTION: <br/>UniDAO aims to introduce transparency, decentralization, and distribution in all organizations by involving everyone in the decision-making process through polls. UniDAO uses a unique poll process where each individual's vote is weighed according to their positional power in the organization, rather than shareholder tokens. UniDAO achieves decentralization through the use of separate DAOs for user/admin enrollment/dis-enrollment and adding new proposals, hence the name UniDAO (Unification of DAOs). Only admins can add proposals, but both admins and users can vote on proposals, with each person having only one vote. The proposal to add another admin is a separate DAO, with only admins allowed to vote. After a proposal expires, the result can be viewed (passed/rejected), but user votes remain anonymous.
